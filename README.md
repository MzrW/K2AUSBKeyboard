Ever have type your 30 characters full strength password on someone else's computer?

Keepass2Android USB Keyboard Plugin is similar to the official InputStick plugin but requires no additional hardware. Just plug your phone into a PC and press type. Your password will be sent to the PC just like you type it.

If you can design a logo, please send me a new one!
